=== HOVERBIKES 0.2 ===

I always wanted to fly on hoverbike. So I decided to do for yourself and others, who did not leave that desire this little mod.

Contains three hoverbikes:

# Human hoverbike
- Classic boxy shape with yellow coloring
- Reduced fuel consumption
- Recipe: Human Mech Chip + 50 Velirium bars + 100 Steel bars + 20 Coal ore

# Hylotls hoverbike
- King shrimp design
- Fast fly speed

# Apex hoverbike

In the future, may be to add hoverbikes other races.

== FAQ ==

Q. Why flying cost so high?
A: This is Hoverbike, not aircraft. But considering the landscapes of Starbound we gave him the ability to fly. Because hoverbikes is high level content (Cerulium upgrade, remember?) player have high level armor and have many energy.

Q. Please add tabularasa support!
A: We use tabularasa for debugging and testing. But tabularasa very bad in terms of balance and original content. We want to add chip as loot in dungeons, but now we cant do this, due the _merge issue (http://community.playstarbound.com/...s-with-__merge-in-default-treasurepool.58007/). So we add craft to robotic table for all users.
