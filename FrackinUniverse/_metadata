  "description" : "***Disclaimer: Installing FU is a one-way trip. FU will affect your game universe *and* *ALL* characters. If you uninstall the mod, your game will inevitably crash, unless you wipe your universe and player folders. THIS CANNOT BE AVOIDED, so please do not request that we 'fix' this. It is not avoidable. If you are not sure you want to keep this mod, be sure to back up your universe and player folders before installing.***\n\nGOT A BUG?!?!\nAll error reports will be *much* easier to fix if you provide a link to the starbound.log file (located in starbound/storage/starbound.log) by opening it in a text editor and pasting its contents to pastebin.com, and then reporting with the link to that log. Without an error log, I will be unable to provide much help.\n\n\nWhat Is FRACKIN UNIVERSE?\n\nPerhaps the largest of the mods for Starbound, FrackinUniverse combines new biomes, a hugely increased crafting system, science, monsters, tiles and hundreds of other assets to the game. It's 3 years in now, and quite encompassing. A few things to expect: \n\nExplore dozens of new biomes \n\nCreate hundreds of new armors, weapons and tools \n\nNew monsters await \n\nhundreds of new art assets \n\nnew quest hub \n\nhundreds of microdungeons \n\na massive sprawling eldritch dungeon \n\naffect the world around you by changing tile composition through liquids. Fire rain will scorch the ground, and healing liquid will turn sticky slime into a useful healing agent. Hundreds of possible interactions exist. \n\npower your lab with technological creations designed to make your resource-gathering easier and more efficient. Just be sure to have some generators and batteries to keep them going! \n\nand so very much more! \n\n\nStarbooze, Science and Bees mods are included! \n\nNote that your character will no longer possess a light aura in darkness, as darkness is an important part of many parts of FU.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: We have modified the EPPs in a fundamental way, and there has been a fair amount of confusion about this. The Breathing EPP provides air on airless planets. Radiation EPP protects you against mild (vanilla) radiation. Heating EPP protects you against mild (vanilla) cold. Cooling EPP protects you against mild (vanilla) heat.\n\nThat is ALL they do, in this mod. For example, the Cooling EPP does NOT protect you against radiation, and it does not provide air in airless environments.\n\nYou're going to have to get more creative, with this mod, to survive in harsh environments. However, this mod also provides you with many methods of avoiding those hazards. Augments, genetically-engineered produce, armors, and advanced EPPs. All craftable.\n\nPlay through the mod, work through the techs (including the genetically engineered plants!), and create stuff. Intro-level things unlock other things, and everything builds up until you are a kick-ass name-taking machine of destruction and SCIENCE.\n\nIn short: Patience, padawan. Persevere, and you will be rewarded.\n\nWiki (player maintained): http://frackinuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/FrackinUniverse_Wiki\n\nCF Forum version found here:   http://community.playstarbound.com/resources/frackinuniverse.2920/\n\nGitHub project version location is here: https://github.com/sayterdarkwynd/FrackinUniverse",
