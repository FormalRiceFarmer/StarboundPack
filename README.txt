This is a single mod containing many other mods, it is recommended that you delete all other mods before using this one, however other mods may not conflict or cause any issues depending on the nature of those mods. Dyeing Bucket is safe to use, for example. The only reason it was not included was due to the large number of small files contained in the mod.
